# SHMCMC
 Subspace Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo

Matlab codes accompaning the paper: Efficient X-ray and Neutron Data Analysis with Subspace Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo

Installation instructions:
1. Install Automatic Differentiation toolbox for Matlab (ADiMat), available at https://www.sc.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/res/sw/adimat/
2. Add path ~/shmcmc (HMCMC functions) to Matlab search path
